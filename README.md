## Documentations ##

[CovScript Document](https://github.com/covscript/covscript-docs)  
[CovScript Tutorial](https://github.com/covscript/covscript-tutorial)  
## Installation ##
### Windows ###
Download the precompiled executable on the [Latest Release](https://github.com/covscript/covscript/releases/latest).   
You can also use other tools (like MinGW) to compile. If you already have a G++ compiler installed, you can use `make.bat`. Make sure the compiler supports C++11.  
**Note: Covariant Script does not compile with Microsoft CL compiler magically.**
### Linux ###
First, download source from [CovScript Github Page](https://github.com/covscript/covscript).  
Then you have two choices:
+ With G++ and makefile
```sh
$ sh ./make.sh
```
+ With CMake toolchain

We've provided a `CMakeLists.txt`.

Make sure your compiler supports C++11.  

**Note: Some distributions' G++ are too old to support C++11, make sure you G++ compiler is up to date.**
### Mac OS ###
All the steps are the same as Linux, tested under macOS Sierra 10.12.5.
## Run ##
### Interpreter ###
`cs [arguments..] <file> <args...>`  
#### Arguments ####
`--compile-only` Only compile.  
`--wait-before-exit` Wait before process exit.  
`--log-path PATH` Set the log path.  
`--import-path PATH` Set the import path.  
### Repl ###
`cs_repl [arguments..]`  
#### Arguments ####
`--args` Specify the operating parameters.  
`--silent` Does not display the version info.  
`--wait-before-exit` Wait before process exit.  
`--log-path PATH` Set the log path.  
`--import-path PATH` Set the import path.  
### Installer ###
Covariant Script Installer provides a simple toolchain configuration method for the Microsoft Windows platform. You can download, install, upgrade and uninstall the toolchain by simply push a button. You can download the latest installer from the [CovScript Programming Language Home](http://covscript.org). For more information, visit the [Covariant Script Installer](https://github.com/covscript/covscript-installer).
### GUI ###
Covariant Script provides a one-stop code editing, running, debugging experience for the Microsoft Windows platform . The CovScript Installer will automatically downloads the CovScript GUI for you. For more information, please visit [Covariant Script GUI](https://github.com/covscript/covscript-gui).
### Package Manager ###
`cspkg` is a package manager written in Covariant Script whose main function is to manage extensions or packages for Covariant Script. `cspkg` will be released with the latest version of Covariant Script. For more information, please visit [Covariant Script Package Manager](https://github.com/covscript/cspkg).
### IntelliJ Plugin ###
The IntelliJ Plugin is available now:
+ [Source Code](https://github.com/covscript/covscript-intellij)
+ [Plugin Repository](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10326-covscript)
## Examples ##
The `examples` folder contains several example programs written by CovScript.

## Comments ##
Comments by [@ice1000](https://github.com/ice1000/):

>This is a programming language created by my friend Michael Lee, written in C++. The detailed description is on it’s website so I’ll just put some comments here. This is a C-like language (at least the function call syntax is of C style), while functions, structs, namespaces are ends with end like Ruby, and it has the concepts of package import using (the module system).  
Its parser is hand-written (very complex, although parsers are trivial), which impressed me (I didn’t even think of that when working on Lice, I just wrote an AST evaluator).  
This language supports invoking functions written in C++, like JNI.  
CovScript mostly features its powerful standard library, which has database, GUI, web access, regular expressions.
